Here is an example of a disabled widget.

Anything in this folder will not show up on your site.

You can use it to store widgets that you make, but maybe don't want to use at the moment.

You could also store the sample widgets here in case you want to reference them later.

You can safely delete this file, as it serves no real purpose now that you know these things.
